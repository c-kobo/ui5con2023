## Exercise 11.3 - Access Deployed Application

To get a list of deployed HTML5 applications, run the following command;

```bash
cf html5-list -di ui5con2023-destination-service -u -rt launchpad
```

This will return a list of deployed apps and the URL they are being hosted against. Press [CTRL] and click the appâ€™s link in the terminal to open the URL in a new browser tab.

To find out more about this `html5-list` option, run the command;
