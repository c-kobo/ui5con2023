# Exercise 2 - Flexible Programming Model: Using Fiori Elements Building Blocks on a Custom Page

The available [Fiori elements floorplans](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/2b2b12e708944d85a40d087194cc1edd.html)
for OData V4 cover most business scenarios that customers encounter with SAP. In fact, SAP uses these SAP Fiori elements floorplans to create roughly 80% of new SAP S/4HANA apps.\
If these floorplans do not meet your needs, the flexible programming model provided by SAP Fiori elements
allows to assemble your custom design by combining the available building blocks with SAPUI5 controls,
and leverage controller extensions in order to fine-tune the behaviour of your app.\
Please be aware that when using custom code in your SAP Fiori elements apps,
you will also have to make sure your extensions remain aligned with the evolving SAP Fiori design specification,
whereas the parts generated by annotations will automatically be updated if the standard changes.\
For our scenario, we want to mimic the behaviour of the list report and combine it with some SAPUI5 controls and add some app specific behaviours.

![](./images/image64.png)

(40) Enter the values as shown in the marked fields below.
Keep the **Binding Context Path Type** set to relative. This makes sure that the metaPath to the LineItem annotation is relative to entity **Travel**.
The **Aggregation Path** defines where building block table is to be inserted in the target xml view. Defining the **Associated Filter Bar ID** ensures that the filter bar can interact with the table.
Leave all other values as proposed.

![](./images/image66.png)

(41) Scroll a bit down and open the drop-down for table property **Enable Read Only Mode**. Select ![](./images/image68.png).

## Exercise 2.3 Page Map: Add Object Page and Switch to Flexible Column Layout

In this exercise we will add an object page to check on the navigation capabilities of the table building block.\
We will then switch the page layout to flexible column layout. The flexible column layout allows users to see more\
details on the page, and to expand and collapse the screen areas.

(55) Click **Add New Page** ![](./images/image92.png).

![](./images/image91.png)

(56) On the **Add Page** dialog, open the drop-down of field **Navigation** and Select **Travel**. This defines the context binding of the object page and
automatically enables navigation for the custom page table.

![](./images/image93.png)

(57) Click ![](./images/image80.png).

![](./images/image95.png)

(58) Enable **Flexible Column Layout** by selecting the corresponding radio button.

(59) For **Select Layout for 2 Columns**, select **Mid-Expanded**.

(60) Below of it, set the **Flex Enabled** drop down to false as we don't require key user adaptation capabilities for the scenario. .

![](./images/image96.png)

As the object page is yet empty, we will define a title and description.

(61) Click **Configure Page**![](./images/image4.png).

![](./images/image99.png)

(62) Click ![](./images/image101.png).

(63) Enter **Travel** in field **Type Name** and create a translatable text key for it.

(64) Enter **Travels** in field **Type Name Plural** and create
another text key for it.

(65) Open drop-down field for **Title** and select property **Description**.

![](./images/image100.png)

(66) Open the drop-down for field **Description Type** and select **Property**.

![](./images/image103.png)

(67) In the **Define Property** dialog, open the drop-down for field **Description** and select ![](./images/image106.png).

![](./images/image105.png)

(68) Click ![](./images/image108.png).

![](./images/image107.png)

(69) Search for property **Editable Header Content** and set it to **false**.

![](./images/image109.png)

Switch back to the preview browser tab. It is now showing the filter bar and the table. Use the selection fields and trigger selection with **Go** to test the connection between both building blocks.\
(70) Click on a table line to navigate to the object page. By using table building block, navigation works solely through the context path without having to apply any additional custom coding.

![](./images/image111.png)

The pages are shown in the flexible column layout. You can use the **expand/collapse** buttons in to upper right corner to change the layout of the screen areas.\
The configured travel description and travel ID are shown in the object page header.

![](./images/image113.png)

## Summary

You've now successfully added building blocks filter bar and table to a custom view.
